Register App: A User Registration Application

Description

User application designed so that a new user can register and login into their accounts. 
The important goal of this project was to develop an application in Python that will allow basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for users. 
Everything was done locally with a PyMongo driver establishing a connection to MongoDB which could handle data 
collection and queries in real-time. This project was developed in IntelliJ.
